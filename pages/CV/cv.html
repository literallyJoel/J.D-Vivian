				<h4>Trainee First Line IT Support Technician</h4>
				<h5>04/2019 - 09/2019</h5>
				<p><em>Simpson Spence Young</em></p>
				<p class="subtext">My primary role was to provide first-line support to
					brokers and other employees at the company. This was
					done both through the phone and in-person, to
					employees both in the London office that I was in, as
					well as offices internationally. I used Zoho Desk to
					manage and respond to tickets. As this was a small IT
					team, I also found myself performing other roles as well,
					such as building computers and servers, performing
					machine upgrades, learning, and eventually performing
					Active Directory maintenance and support. During my
					time in this role, I also helped the company recover from
					a cyber-attack, and made several pieces of bespoke
					software for use by the IT team I worked within.

				<h4>First Line Customer Support Technician</h4>
				<h5>07/2018 - 09/2018</h5>
				<p><em>Simpson Spence Young</em></p>
				<p class="subtext">During my time here I was part of the customer support
					team for the CJSM service, providing phone support to
					users of the service who were having issues. This
					involved guiding users on how to use the software, as
					well as performing actions such as password resets. I
					used Zendesk to manage and respond to tickets. On
					some occasions, I also served as a customer support
					technician for the Egress Switch software, primarily
					when service issues meant there was a high volume of
					customer support calls and emails. As well as this, I also covered reception duties for an
					hour each day - acting as the face of the company to
					any visitors to the office, as well as those who called the
					general company number.

					parents evenings, and the yearly school production.

				<h4>2 Weeks Work Experience</h4>

					across several fields, including the types of IT issues that
					are encountered in a commercial environment, as well
					as skills in customer interaction through the Marketing

					Hounslow Library, interacting with members of the
					public to help get them interested in the cause.
